This is the README for an application that lets users keep track of all of their craft supplies, pattern information, and projects. Users will be able to update their inventory for a multitude of crafting supplies, have a running index of their patterns, and be able to track their progress on their projects (ranging from gathering materials all the way to completion, including a list of materials needed/already have).

This is the back end, created using Ruby on Rails. For the front end, see https://github.com/rnovick13/CraftStashFront

To use, run
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
rails s
